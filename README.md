## Key points

•	lncRNAs abound in the ventricular-subventricular zone
•	The functions of lncRNAs are obscure, but are implicated in cancer
•	scRNAseq data has resolved the expression patterns of many V-SVZ lncRNAs
•	scRNAseq data suggest lncRNAs function in stem cell maintenance and activation

## Summary 

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function through the process of transcription or through transcript-dependent associations with protein or nucleic acids. LncRNAs influence gene regulatory networks and many are transcribed in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), the largest postnatal brain neural stem cell niche. LncRNAs in the V-SVZ are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer, and brain disease, but their functions are poorly understood. The V-SVZ neurogenic capacity declines with age due to stem cell depletion and NSC resistance to activation. In this review we analysed V-SVZ transcriptomics by pooling current single cell RNA-seq data. We found consistent lncRNA expression during stem cell activation, lineage progression and aging. In conjunction with epigenetic and genetic data, we predicted lncRNAs that regulate stem cell activation and differentiation. Some lncRNAs validated known epigenetic mechanisms, however, most remain un-investigated. Our analysis points to several lncRNAs that likely participate in key aspects of V-SVZ stem cell activation and neurogenesis in health and disease.
