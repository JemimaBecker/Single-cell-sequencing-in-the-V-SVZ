## Abstract

NB ABSTRACT FROM CURRENT DRAFT NOT FINALISED

The age of mechanism is over - this is the age of descriptive â€˜omics. Good because the brain development regulated by a large number of intersecting gene regulatory networks, but ultimately these require functional confirmation. 

lncRNAs influence these gene regulatory networks, and many are specifically enriched in neural stem cells of the V-SVZ, the largest stem cell niche in the postnatal brain and can function therein to regulate neurogenesis. However they have also been strongly implicated in cancer, and their modulation linked to brain disease and neurodevelopmental disorders. 

The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) is a neurogenic stem cell niche that mounts a regenerative response to brain injury throughout life, and can be induced to generate new neurons to minimise damage, as well as being a source of gliomas. However, the neurogenic capacity of the V-SVZ declines with age due to both neural stem cell (NSC) depletion, as well as NSCs becoming increasingly resistant to activation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNA, afforded rich structural and functional diversity by their ability to associate with both proteins and nucleic acids. 

A large number of papers have recently described V-SVZ transcriptomics and in this review we have analysed those from which information on lncRNAs can be extracted. Several interesting patterns emerge. Pooling of scRNAseq data has revealed consistent trends in lncRNA expression both during stem cell activation and lineage progression, as well as during ageing. Taking these results in conjunction with epigenetic and genetic data has allowed prediction of lncRNA genes that may be acting to regulate stem cell activation and differentiation. Some of the predicted lncRNAs have been shown to be important for the regulation of neurogenesis via epigenetic mechanisms (such as Dlx6as), thus validating this approach. However, many remain uninvestigated.
