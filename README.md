## Bullet points
 
-	lncRNAs abound in the ventricular-subventricular zone 
-	The functions of lncRNAs are obscure, but some are implicated in development and cancer 
-	scRNAseq data has resolved the expression patterns of many V-SVZ lncRNAs 
-	scRNAseq data suggest lncRNAs function in stem cell maintenance and activation 

## Summary
Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) function is mediated by the process of transcription or through transcript-dependent associations with proteins or nucleic acids to control gene regulatory networks. Many lncRNAs are transcribed in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), a postnatal neural stem cell niche. LncRNAs in the V-SVZ are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer, and brain disease, but their functions are poorly understood. V-SVZ neurogenesis capacity declines with age due to stem cell depletion and NSC activation resistance. Here we analysed V-SVZ transcriptomics by pooling current single cell RNA-seq data. They showed consistent lncRNA expression during stem cell activation, lineage progression and aging. In conjunction with epigenetic and genetic data, we predicted V-SVZ lncRNAs that regulate stem cell activation and differentiation. Some lncRNAs validated known epigenetic mechanisms, however, most remain un-investigated. Our analysis points to several lncRNAs that likely participate in key aspects of V-SVZ stem cell activation and neurogenesis in health and disease.
