> Figure 3: Data summary for scRNAseq meta-analysis. 
> A: Total number of studies in which each lncRNA is differentially expressed across all categories, data is expressed as log2(number of lncRNAs) vs the number of studies that each gene was differentially expressed in. 
> B: Overlap between lncRNAs differentially expressed with stem cell activation (n=750) and those that are downregulated with ageing (n=28). 
> C: EnrichR gene ontology results for transcription factors that bind the promoters of lncRNAs downregulated with age. EnrichR was run on PSCAN outputs to find ontologies of transcription factors that bind each promoter, the number of lncRNA promoters that were associated with each GO term is shown.

## 1: Conduct PSCAN

PCAN was conducted with via the web server (http://159.149.160.88/pscan/) to examine 

## 2: Conduct GO via Enrichr

## 3: Plot
