# scRNAseq papers

A literature search was conducted to identify research articles that made use of single cell RNA sequencing in the V-SVZ using the following searches in  Scopus: ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "V-SVZ"  OR  svz  OR  sez  OR  "subventricular zone"  OR  "subependymal zone" )  AND  TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "scRNAseq"  OR  "single cell sequencing" ) )  and in GEO DataSets: ((V-SVZ OR SVZ OR subventricular OR subependymal OR SEZ)) AND "mus musculus"[Organism]. The majority of papers identified, document the murine V-SVZ, 14 of these were chosen for analysis (Basak et al., 2018; Belenguer et al., 2021; Cebrian-Silla et al., 2021; Del Aguila et al., 2022; Kalamakis et al., 2019; Kriska et al., 2021; Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015; Mizrak et al., 2020; Mizrak et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2020; Zamboni et al., 2020; Zywitza et al., 2018). Eight of these were chosen for further study because in depth results of their analyses were available (Yan et al., 2022a). Papers and data was chosen that examined healthy brains in the absence of any treatment, genetic manipulation or pathology.
